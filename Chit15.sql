Here's a step-by-step guide with MongoDB queries to achieve the mentioned operations:

### 1. Create the database `Institute`

```js
use Institute;
```

### 2. Create the collection `Students`

```js
db.createCollection("Students");
```

### 3. Insert 10 documents with the mentioned structure

```js
db.Students.insertMany([
  { RollNo: 1, StudentName: "Rohan", Age: 16, Branch: "Science", Address: { City: "Mumbai", State: "Maharashtra" }, Hobbies: ["Cricket", "Music"] },
  { RollNo: 2, StudentName: "Amit", Age: 17, Branch: "Commerce", Address: { City: "Pune", State: "Maharashtra" }, Hobbies: ["Football", "Reading"] },
  { RollNo: 3, StudentName: "Sneha", Age: 15, Branch: "Arts", Address: { City: "Nashik", State: "Maharashtra" }, Hobbies: ["Dance", "Singing"] },
  { RollNo: 4, StudentName: "Ankita", Age: 14, Branch: "Science", Address: { City: "Pune", State: "Maharashtra" }, Hobbies: ["Painting", "Drawing"] },
  { RollNo: 5, StudentName: "Karan", Age: 18, Branch: "Science", Address: { City: "Pune", State: "Maharashtra" }, Hobbies: ["Swimming", "Coding"] },
  { RollNo: 6, StudentName: "Priya", Age: 16, Branch: "Commerce", Address: { City: "Mumbai", State: "Maharashtra" }, Hobbies: ["Photography", "Music"] },
  { RollNo: 7, StudentName: "Raj", Age: 17, Branch: "Arts", Address: { City: "Pune", State: "Maharashtra" }, Hobbies: ["Chess", "Cycling"] },
  { RollNo: 8, StudentName: "Anjali", Age: 15, Branch: "Science", Address: { City: "Aurangabad", State: "Maharashtra" }, Hobbies: ["Skating", "Music"] },
  { RollNo: 9, StudentName: "Akash", Age: 18, Branch: "Arts", Address: { City: "Pune", State: "Maharashtra" }, Hobbies: ["Photography", "Cricket"] },
  { RollNo: 10, StudentName: "Neha", Age: 14, Branch: "Commerce", Address: { City: "Pune", State: "Maharashtra" }, Hobbies: ["Reading", "Painting"] }
]);
```

### 4. Display all students' information

```js
db.Students.find().pretty();
```

### 5. Display Student information whose age is greater than 15

```js
db.Students.find({ Age: { $gt: 15 } }).pretty();
```

### 6. Display Student information sorted on the name field

```js
db.Students.find().sort({ StudentName: 1 }).pretty();
```

### 7. Update student branch to "Computer" for RollNo 3

```js
db.Students.updateOne(
  { RollNo: 3 },
  { $set: { Branch: "Computer" } }
);
```

### 8. Remove the document with RollNo 1

```js
db.Students.deleteOne({ RollNo: 1 });
```

### 9. Display Student information whose name starts with 'A'

```js
db.Students.find({ StudentName: { $regex: '^A' } }).pretty();
```

### 10. Display the total number of documents available in the collection

```js
db.Students.countDocuments();
```

### 11. Display only the first 5 documents

```js
db.Students.find().limit(5).pretty();
```

### 12. Display all documents except the first 3

```js
db.Students.find().skip(3).pretty();
```

### 13. Display the name of students who live in Pune city

```js
db.Students.find({ "Address.City": "Pune" }, { StudentName: 1, _id: 0 }).pretty();
```

### 14. Display only the names of all students

```js
db.Students.find({}, { StudentName: 1, _id: 0 }).pretty();
```

### 15. Drop the `Students` collection

```js
db.Students.drop();
```

These commands cover the operations like creating a collection, inserting data, querying with conditions, updating, and deleting documents, and managing views with MongoDB using the provided sample structure.
